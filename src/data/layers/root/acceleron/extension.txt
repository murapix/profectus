Start off with 2 more loops, another row of upgrades, and more entropy/entropy enhancements

1st loop = ???
2nd loop = base of the endless stairwell

The Endless Stairwell:
- More upgrades, more loops
- Main new features: temporal precipitate and virtualization

-----------------------------------
1st loop: 1 millenium = 1e3
2nd loop: 10 millenia = 1e4
3rd loop: 100 millenia = 1e5
4th loop: 1 billion years = 1e6
...
7th loop: 1 aeon = 1e9
38th loop: 1 degenerate era = 1e40
98th loop: 1 black hole era = 1e100
100th loop: 100 black hole eras, the final loop

Need 7 loops to complete 3rd entangled string (single expansion)
15 to complete 4th entangled string (double expansion) - require resources from said second expansion
31 to complete 5th entangled string (triple expansion) - require resources from both other expansions
63 to complete 6th entangled string (quadruple expansion) - require resources from all three other expansions
100 to complete 7th entangled string (quintuple expansion) - require resources from all four other expansions
-----------------------------------
1st loop adds 4 particles
2nd loop adds 3 more
3rd loop adds 2 more
4th loop adds 1 more
8th loop adds another
16th loop again
32nd once more
64th adds the final particle
Every loop between increases particle rates for lower loops

Each particle loop will produce a random particle of its selection 
-----------------------------------
Virtualization: the process by which particles are generated from incomplete loops

All particles start off at just a percentage chance per gameplay second to generate, based on the time speed and generating loop duration
Further loops, entropic enhancements, particles, and upgrades increase this percentage and smooth out the randomness
